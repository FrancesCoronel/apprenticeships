## Guidelines

### Text

- Check your spelling and grammar using a tool like [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com)
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace

### Links

- The link should not be to a direct link to the application page unless that's all that is available
- The link should link to the page describing the apprenticeship program or the closest thing to that

### Images

- The featured image should include the company's logo
- Please avoid any images that focus on individuals and show faces since this can bias users
- You don't have to worry about compressing or optimizing your image, we use [ImgBot](https://github.com/apps/imgbot) to do that but we recommend keeping all images under 250 KB

## Making a Pull Request

- The pull request should have a useful title, like `Add [name of apprenticeship]` instead of `Update README`.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
