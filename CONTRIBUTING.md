## Making a Pull Request

- The pull request should have a useful title, like `Add [name of apprenticeship]` instead of `Update README`.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.

### Formatting

```markdown
- [Name of apprenticeship](link to website explaining details of apprenticeship)
```

- The link should not be to a direct link to the application page.
- Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com).
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- Suggestions (apprenticeship or further resource) should be sorted **alphabetically**.
    - You can use something similar to Sublime Text's built in [Sort Lines](https://www.abeautifulsite.net/sorting-lines-of-text-alphabetically-with-sublime-text-3) shortcut to make this easy.
- Suggestions should be categorized by the right country and also sorted alphabetically with the United States showing first.
    - e.g. United States, England, Portugal, etc.
